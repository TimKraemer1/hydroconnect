## Overview

HydroConnect is an IoT water sensing system designed as a capstone project for **CSE 123A/B** at UCSC, completed during the Winter and Spring quarters of 2024. The device attaches underneath any standard faucet to monitor and measure water consumption in real-time. This repository contains all source code for the system components including the sensor firmware, mobile app, and web server backend.

---

## Features

- **Real-time water consumption tracking** via an attachable IoT sensor  
- **MQTT-based communication** between sensor and backend  
- **Mobile app** with QR code scanning, user authentication, and live data display  
- **Web server** managing data storage and API endpoints

---

## Technologies Used

- ESP-based microcontroller programmed in Arduino IDE (`flow_sensor.ino`)  
- MQTT Broker implemented in Python (`broker.py`)  
- Mobile app developed in Swift using XCode and SwiftUI  
- Backend web server built with Python and Flask (`app.py`)  
- Database management with Python (`db.py`)

## Capstone Project

This project was completed as part of my senior capstone coursework, showcasing skills in embedded systems, IoT, mobile development, and backend server design.
